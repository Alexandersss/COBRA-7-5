	FERROX COBRA 4.82 COBRA 7.55

As of December 6rd 2017, following has been changed and updated since 4.46 COBRA 7

	[ Joonie's Changes ]

	* Firmware spoofing is disabled due to the changes of PSN Auth since 4.60
	* PLS3 patches are removed from modulespatch.c since this is one of those pre-applied patches on 4.xx CFW
	* unknown E3 patches are removed to fix an issue with XMB, [Originally found by rancid-0, from his PS3ITA 4.50 COBRA]
	* Dual VSH supported for REBUG REX / D-REX CFW, with the proper hash check code was developed by habib and Nzv recently. 
	* NPDRM Fself fix is no longer used due to improved fself patches hard coded within the firmware modules on REX/D-REX 

	[ Habib's changes ]

	* Stage0 and stage0 base are merged, (Optimization on stage0 and stage1)
	* Syscall 11 is added to support full lv1 peek.
	* Syscall 15 is added to allow execution of any lv2 internal function.
	* Allow Syscall 11 to gain full access to syscall 6/7/9/10 to prevent modification from homebrews like multiMAN.
	* PS2 Launcher is no longer needed due to new codes in storage_ext, now COBRA can behave the same way that VSH does to apply configuration of DS3 controllers. 
	* PS2 Launcher can still be used, which allows PS2ISO with netemu on backward compatible consoles.
	* PS2 Netemu toggle is added for Backward compatible consoles, it is very useful for those units with broken EE/GS chips as well.
	* PS2 Netemu can now use decrypted CONFIG, place the game config file in the same game path for ex) 
			dev_hdd0/PS2ISO/GOW.ISO
			dev_hdd0/PS2ISO/GOW.ISO.CONFIG 
	* HASH calculation algorithm is changed, now it uses static hashes, so the hashes will not be changed unless modules have major changes.
	* Stealth extension support to disable Syscall 15
	* Allows temporary LV1 peek from syscall 8 when "disabling COBRA" is not used

	* webMAN integration on boot. Also disables external webMAN plugin located in dev_hdd0 (Disabled for REBUG 4.82.1 LITE)
	* PSN Patch stealth mode, it remove custom syscall from the ps3
	* Homebrew blocker added, when Syscalls are disabled by plugins or homebrews, it will prevent homebrews from being launched, and it will return as 80010006 on XMB.

	[ Dean's changes ] 

	* Improved map_path, to fix the issue with games like Shadow of Mordor
	* Permission protection is disabled to increase game compatiblity and full DEX support.[no more issue with Target Manager or CCAPI]

	[ Nzv's changes]

	* PS3MAPI 1.2.2 support, it is similar feature comparing to CCAPI, but open sourced project and also can unload vsh plugins , attatch process on all type of EBOOT.
	One of those great debugging features.
	* Partial disable syscall8 and unhooks all cobra hooks (Part of PS3MAPI)
	* Block update from disc

	* Improved PSX media type support, now it supports following disc types
	* 2048 // 2352 // 2336 // 2448 *
	* Improved Video mode patch with proper region detection
	Original COBRA payload was relying on ps1emu's detection method, now COBRA has extra pre-processing that can detect region properly and force apply correct refresh rate depending on the game's region.
	(Improved PS3MAPI functions)
	* Added PEEK/POKE (LV1/LV2) as PS3MAPI opcodes (syscall8)
